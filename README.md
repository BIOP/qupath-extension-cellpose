# QuPath Cellpose extension

This repo adds some support to use 2D Cellpose within QuPath through a Python virtual environment.


## Installing

Download the latest `qupath-extension-cellpose-[version].jar` file from [releases](https://github.com/biop/qupath-extension-cellpose/releases) and drag it onto the main QuPath window.

If you haven't installed any extensions before, you'll be prompted to select a QuPath user directory.
The extension will then be copied to a location inside that directory.

You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).

## Installing Cellpose

Follow the instructions to install Cellpose from [the main Cellpose repository](https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose).
This extension will need to know the path to your Cellpose environment.

## Running

Running Cellpose is done via a script and is very similar to the excellent [QuPath StarDist Extension](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-stardist)


```groovy
import qupath.ext.biop.cellpose.Cellpose2D

TODO
// Specify the model .pb file (you will need to change this!)
def pathModel = '/path/to/dsb2018_heavy_augment.pb'

def stardist = StarDist2D.builder(pathModel)
        .threshold(0.5)              // Probability (detection) threshold
        .channels('DAPI')            // Select detection channel
        .normalizePercentiles(1, 99) // Percentile normalization
        .pixelSize(0.5)              // Resolution for detection
        .cellExpansion(5.0)          // Approximate cells based upon nucleus expansion
        .cellConstrainScale(1.5)     // Constrain cell expansion using nucleus size
        .measureShape()              // Add shape measurements
        .measureIntensity()          // Add cell measurements (in all compartments)
        .includeProbability(true)    // Add probability as a measurement (enables later filtering)
        .build()

// Run detection for the selected objects
def imageData = getCurrentImageData()
def pathObjects = getSelectedObjects()
if (pathObjects.isEmpty()) {
    Dialogs.showErrorMessage("StarDist", "Please select a parent object!")
    return
}
stardist.detectObjects(imageData, pathObjects)
println 'Done!'
```

## Citing

If you use this extension, you should cite the original Cellpose publication
- Stringer, C., Wang, T., Michaelos, M. et al. 
[*Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03535)
Nat Methods 18, 100â€“106 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-01018-x

You should also cite the QuPath publication, as described [here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/intro/citing.html).


## Building

You can build the QuPath StarDist extension from source with

```bash
gradlew clean build
```

The output will be under `build/libs`.

* `clean` removes anything old
* `build` builds the QuPath extension as a *.jar* file and adds it to `libs`
