# QuPath Cellpose extension

This repo adds some support to use 2D Cellpose within QuPath through a Python virtual environment.


## Installing

Download the latest `qupath-extension-cellpose-[version].jar` file from [releases](https://github.com/biop/qupath-extension-cellpose/releases) and drag it onto the main QuPath window.

If you haven't installed any extensions before, you'll be prompted to select a QuPath user directory.
The extension will then be copied to a location inside that directory.

You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).

## Installing Cellpose

Follow the instructions to install Cellpose from [the main Cellpose repository](https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose).
This extension will need to know the path to your Cellpose environment.

## Running

Running Cellpose is done via a script and is very similar to the excellent [QuPath StarDist Extension](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-stardist)


```groovy
import qupath.ext.biop.cellpose.Cellpose2D

TODO
// Specify the model name (cyto, nuc, cyto2 or a path to your custom model)
def pathModel = 'cyto'

def cellpose = Cellpose2D.builder(pathModel)
        .probabilityThreshold(0.3)   // Probability (detection) threshold
        .channels('DAPI')            // Select detection channel(s)
        .normalizePercentiles(1, 99) // Percentile normalization
        .pixelSize(0.5)              // Resolution for detection
        .diameter(30)                // Average diameter of objects in px (at the requested pixel sie)
        .cellExpansion(5.0)          // Approximate cells based upon nucleus expansion
        .cellConstrainScale(1.5)     // Constrain cell expansion using nucleus size
        .measureShape()              // Add shape measurements
        .measureIntensity()          // Add cell measurements (in all compartments)
        .includeProbability(true)    // Add probability as a measurement (enables later filtering)
        .build()

// Run detection for the selected objects
def imageData = getCurrentImageData()
def pathObjects = getSelectedObjects()
if (pathObjects.isEmpty()) {
    Dialogs.showErrorMessage("Cellpose", "Please select a parent object!")
    return
}
cellpose.detectObjects(imageData, pathObjects)
println 'Done!'
```

## Citing

If you use this extension, you should cite the original Cellpose publication
- Stringer, C., Wang, T., Michaelos, M. et al. 
[*Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03535)
Nat Methods 18, 100â€“106 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-01018-x

**You should also cite the QuPath publication, as described [here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/intro/citing.html).**


## Building

You can build the QuPath Cellpose extension from source with

```bash
gradlew clean build
```

The output will be under `build/libs`.

* `clean` removes anything old
* `build` builds the QuPath extension as a *.jar* file and adds it to `libs`

## First Run

If you never ran Cellpose before, it will download its pretrained models the first time you run it. This may take some time and we've experienced the process hanging. If it hangs during the download  go to `Run > Kill Running Script`. Then run the script again. It will continue downloading the pretrained models. You may need to do this more than once...

Another alternative is to run cellpose once from the command line before running it within QuPath.
